        <h4> Amidst <b>increasing market volatility and the specter of rising rates </b>, now may be a good time for banks
            to invest
            in long-term growth and profitability via strategic acquisitions. However, such an approach can be ineffectual
            if the acquirer doesn’t have a solid balance sheet and a stable risk profile. By making acquisitions while the
            market is at a low, acquirers improve their chances of outperforming in the years following the deal.
            Acquisitions made during market highs often lead to post-acquisition underperformance,
            simply due to the timing of the market cycle and its subsequent effect on synergies.

    <h4>
        <b> Acquisitions May be the Best Solution to Improve Fundamentals: </b>
        Two foreboding problems are facing banks right now: Credit exposures and interest rate limbo.
        Specifically, banks need to decrease their exposures by diversifying their loan portfolios while still
        ensuring that their core loans remain intact in order to maintain steady net interest income when rates rise.
        These problems can be addressed by making acquisitions of entire enterprises or select loan portfolios

    <h4>To emphasize the value that Wachovia delivered to WFC relative to other deals in its cohort,
        we can look at the following ROE graphs:</h4>

    <h3><b>Conclusion:</b></h3>
    <h4>Overall, with a track record of making solid acquisitions for growth while at the same time
        maintaining superior credit quality relative to its peers, WFC is uniquely poised to weather the current
        macro environment. Its purchase of a $32 billion loan portfolio from GE Capital late last year shows that
        it continues to make acquisitions with expansion in mind, and we believe this is key to its future growth</h4>
