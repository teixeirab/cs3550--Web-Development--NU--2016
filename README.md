<b> This repository consists of two parts: <b/>

    1. The class semester long assignment
    2. Simuly (my project)

The class semester long assignment cosisted of building a sort of google forms website. Users could create and share
forms that would be filled by other users in the web.

Simuly is a stock simulation game where users can compete against each other to determine who is the best investor.
Differently than regular trading simulations Simuly is a turns based app that uses historical fundamental data rather
than real time data. The app was built under the MEAN stack framework.
